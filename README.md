## Hi, I'm Ben Climer👋

I’m a tinkerer and Automation Developer. I spend most of my spare time building tools that make life easier for Managed Service Providers (MSPs), automators, and anyone who loves a clean workflow.

🔭 Currently working on:

Schema Doctor
 — an OpenAPI-first utility that helps developers clean, validate, and reduce schemas for automation platforms.

Tenant ID Finder
 — a lightweight tool for discovering Microsoft 365 / Azure tenant IDs quickly.

Expanding my side projects into shareable utilities and lightweight apps that support automation communities.

🎙 Outside of code:
I co-host the Panda Award Show Podcast
, where we mix career talk with humor, community stories, and absurd tech nostalgia.

👯 Looking to collaborate on:

OpenAPI tooling

Automation frameworks

MSP-focused utilities and integrations

💬 Ask me about:
Automation, RMM systems, OpenAPI schema design, workflow tooling, and building weird-but-useful side projects.
